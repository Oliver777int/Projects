# Autonomous robot object detection using yolov5.

Note that the main file "kiwi_detectionV2.py" will not run since several dependencies are missing. The code files are just to show the implementation. kiwicar.py contains a class for the autonomous robot which allows it to move and avoid collisions. The yolov5n.py file uses a trained object detection model to detect other robots.
